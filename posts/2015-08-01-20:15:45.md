######1. Install Node.js
a) Check to see if you have already installed node.js by opening up your Terminal (cmd + space: 'terminal') and typing in  
`node -v`

 b) If no version number is returned as an output or you would like to upgrade your current version, click on this link to install node: http://nodejs.org/.

 c) Once you have reached the site, hit the large green 'INSTALL' button and wait for the node.dmg to be downloaded.

 d) Install the package. Open the .dmg and going through the installation wizard steps. 

 e) Check your PATH[^2]. When completed, the installation manager on the summary page should prompt you to make sure that usr/local/bin is in your $PATH. Check your path by going back to your terminal and entering:  
`echo $PATH`

######2. Create a "Node" build system in Sublime Text.
 a) Open Sublime Text

 b) From the main toolbar at the top of your screen, select  
`Tools -> Build System -> New Build System`

 c) Sublime will open a new tab called 'untitled.sublime-build' and with the following contents:  
    ```{
	    "shell_cmd": "make"
}```

 Use 'cmd + a' on your keyboard to select all of the text and replace all of the text with the following snippet:  
```{
    "cmd": ["/usr/local/bin/node","$file"]
}```

 d) Save your build system. Use 'cmd + s' and save your file as 'node.sublime-build' in the default directory for packages. (You should already be in this directory when you open the save prompt: Library/Application Support/SublimeText(2 or 3)/Packages/User)

######3. Restart Sublime Text Editor
 Once you have saved, close out all files open in Sublime Text, quit the program ('cmd + q'). Reopen the program.
 

######4. Check to see if your console is working
 a) Select your new build system from the main toolbar at the top:  
`Tools -> Build System -> node'
 
 b) Use 'cmd + n' to create a new file and save it as 'test.js'. 

 c) In your new file, type in:  
`console.log('hello')`  

 d) Hit 'cmd + b' to run your program and the console showing 'hello' should appear at the bottom of your screen. Use 'cmd + b' each time you want to run your program.

NOTE: If you are seeing an error, try replacing "/usr/local/bin/node" in step 2c with just "node".
